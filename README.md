Resident Evil 7 had a few DLCs, and among these, one was called Banned Footage. Within this were several minigames, with my favorite being '21'. Unlike RE7's version, mine does not include death or dismemberment.
Each player shares a deck of cards labeled 1-11. Each player then hits or stays, and their turn ends. Once both players choose to stay consecutively, the game ends, and their totals are tallied up.
I though this would be a relatively simple thing to code for my first python project, and I am glad that things seem to be working as intended.

THINGS IN THE RE7 VERSION NOT IN MINE:
  1. A cumulative betting system. That will be my next thing to implement, as I liked the idea that if you lost too many times, your character 'died'. I do not plan on implementing real death.
  2. Trump cards. I would love to throw these in. They would certainly be a monster. It essentially adds a second 'trump' deck, and each player gets a 'trump' hand. Before hitting or staying, you can play as many trump cards as you want to turn the tide in your favor. I may change the name and call them something else...
